## Arduino Components

Developing for an Arduino involves a number of key components. These are:

1. A PC running the Arduino IDE that is connected by a `USB` cable to and programs,
1. The Arduino `board` - this is the small, single board `microcontroller`;
1. Electronic components that the Arduino `board` controls.

## PC

### Arduino IDE

The Arduino IDE allows you to create, compile and upload code to your Arduino.

## The Arduino Board

### Power

The Arduino is powered either by `USB` when connected to your PC, or via the 5V power input.

### Output pins

## Significant Electronic components


### Common Electronic Components

There any an almost limitless set of electronic components you can use with your Arduino. The following are significant electronic components that you would use in developing for the Arduino.

### The Breadboard
