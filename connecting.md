## COM port

### What is the `COM` port? 

The `COM` port is data communication gateway between your PC and the Arduino board. In order to program the board (from your Arduino IDE), you need to connect your Arduino IDE to the correct `COM` port that your PC is using to communicate with the Arduino board.

The `COM` port can be any number `1 to 256`, however it is usually under `10` - e.g. `COM3` or `COM4`.

### Selecting the right COM port

Within the Arduino IDE select `Tools -> Port`:
